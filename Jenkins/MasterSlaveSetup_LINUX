Scenario 1: 

Adding Linux slave to jenkins master over ssh

*************

Start the master machine

Start the linux slave

 Install git 

 > yum install git -y

Install java
 
> yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel

Install maven

 > yum install maven -y


Connect Master to slave

*****

Step 1: Configure tools ===> and the chnage jenkins URL

Step 2:  go to configure global security ==> Scroll down to Agent ==>provide Agent port ==> select Random

Step 3: Manage nodes and clouds

Configuration of Agent - 3 important points:
****************
1. You need to give the path of the directory on Agent where workspace has to created by master

On the Agent - perform these steps

   > create an empty directory on slave
   > note the path of the directory :  /tmp/jenkinsdir20
   > give read write execute permissions to the directory

On the master -- give the path of the directory



2. label : giving a tag to the slave

  QA -- 3 servers ==> label all of them as QA_slave

 On the job you will specify label so as to execute it on the agent ==> execute on QA_slave


3. launch or connect to the slave


 ==> if it is linux slave connect using SSH

 ==> give the private ip of the slave under HOST

 ===> credentials

    ==> username & password on slave and connect using it through jenkins

 OR

  ==> you can use username and AWS pem key to connect
 
       > Select SSH username and private key

give id => id20
give description ==> linux_slave20

username ==> ec2-user

AddKey ==> add here


go to AWS ==> on the linux slave see the key name on extreme right

go to downloads folder of your machine --> search the key file and open it with notepad

==> copy the contents of the notepad and paste it on the master user ENTER DIRECTLY

==> save 

Select the credentials form the drop down now


Host Key Verification Strategy ==> Non verifying verification startegy



Availability ==> keep this agent online as much as possible

Nodes ==> select tool locations

give location for git ==> /usr/bin/git

give localtion for java ===>  /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-1.8.0.302.b08-0.amzn2.0.1.x86_64


And save the configuration.

Slave will connect to master successfully
